## Interests
I'm interested in both **Research** or **Development** of machine learning models with actual user/item data in various domains.
Although my personal projects mainly involved utilizing NLP methodologies for recommendation in the music domain, I have indulged in various Computer Vision projects to solve tasks like object detection and classification as well. Therefore I'm confident in applying various models from the field of NLP or Computer Vision to real life data, and genuinely intrigued to explore 
new models in new domains as well.
