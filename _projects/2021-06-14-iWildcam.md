In my third semester at SNU GSDS, there was a group project in a computer vision lecture. Our team was free to choose from
any topic in the field of computer vision, and chose a wildlife animal counting project. It was a competition in Kaggle that was already finished,
so the team decided to only use the data to attempt new methods of object tracking. The unique task had to count the number of each different class of animals
that appeared in a 10 frame video, which required object detection, classification, and on top of that, distinguishing animals that disappear and reappear in the video from
new animals.

## Motivation
1. Find a novel way of counting wildlife animals
  - Requires a novel way since the task is far from simple counting
    - Count how many of each species is visible across a sequence of images
  - Previous method disregarded the fact that reappearing animals can exist
    - Simply used the maximum value of animals that appeared in a single frame as final count
2. Apply renowned models(built in TensorFlow) in classification and object detection to real life data

## Project Outline
- Data Preprocessing: Cluster images by their sequence IDs to make sequence data representing each video.
- Methodology Research: Research methods for object detection, object tracking and classification.
- Model Development: Write code for object tracking + classification to solve counting problem
  1. Object Detection: Already done with annotated data given.
  2. Classification: Using detected objects and bounding boxes, crop the image and classify using EfficientNet.
  3. Centroid Object Tracking: Using a sequence of images + detected and classified objects, apply centroid tracking to count the number of animals.
- Train & Evaluation: Train the model and evaluate with test data.

## Result
- Successfully coded the wildlife animal counting (centroid object tracking + classification) system.
- Fair evaluation results, since the focus was on finding a novel method that would take account information disregarded in past methods.
  - In this data, most images contained 0 ~ 1 animals, which allowed a simple max counting method to work.

## Personal Contributions | Skill Development
1. **Literature Review**: I reviewed papers in the field of Computer Vision (ex. EfficientNet) for reference of the project.
2. **Model Development**: Using TensorFlow, I coded the pipeline for centroid object tracking to count the number of animals.
3. **Paper**: I wrote parts of the final paper about this project.

## Obstacles
Here are a few important obstacles I faced during this project.
- **No prior experience with object tracking**
  - I only had experience with classification and object detection.
  - **Solution**: Utilized numerous online materials like ones on [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/23/simple-object-tracking-with-opencv/){:.heading.flip-title} to acquire knowledge and learn from code examples. Extensively utilized stackoverflow.
- **Had to solve a unique problem of wildlife counting**
  - The task was to detect animals in multiple frames, classify and track them to know which are the same and which are different. 
  - **Solution**: Reviewed numerous papers on object tracking and classification to get an idea of which method to implement, and also reached out to a professor ([Joonseok Lee](http://www.joonseok.net/home.html){:.heading.flip-title}) who was an expert in Computer Vision for great advice.
