Last February, I got an email from a reporter at TechExplore wanting to feature one of my group projects [Music-Circles](../../resume.md). She said she found the project through the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13350) on arXiv, and was intrigued by the content. Today, the article was published on the [TechExplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2021-03-music-circles-interactive-visualization-tool.html) website. Please have a look!
