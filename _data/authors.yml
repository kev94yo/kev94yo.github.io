    Hi, my name is Kihong and I'm currently a masters student in the Graduate School of Data Science at Seoul National University (Expected to graduate Feb 2022).
    My personal research is mainly on utilizing various methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for music recommendation, but have experience with various Computer Vision
    and Data Visualization projects as well. 

    I worked at Google as a software engineer intern, and experienced full developer workflow in the TensorFlow model optimization team. 
    My project involved conducting research on quantization error metrics, and using the results to develop an auto-quantization API for machine learning models.

    Currently, I'm actively looking for a job as a machine learning engineer / data scientist / software engineer.
    If anyone is interested in working together, please reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kihong-seong-50b34a86/){:.heading.flip-title}
    or <kev94yo@gmail.com>{:.heading.flip-title}. 

    When I'm free, I usually attend gigs, listen to music or play drums :)
